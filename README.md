# C-D-Nozzle
1.Numerical Solution of Flow through CD Nozzle using van Leer Flux Vector Splitting Method

2.The aim of this project is to compare the numerical solution with exact solution (ientropic solution)
# How to run the code.
1.The code is written in python.

2.File name is saved in .py format

3.The code is written using Vscode and the libray used in the code are numpy and matplotlib.

4.Results we got here compares the numerical solution with exact solution
